# HTML/CSS assignment

This is the first assignment at [EC Utbildning](https://ecutbildning.se/) where I am studying WebDev .Net.
I was given a Figma file that I am using to design the page.

## HTML/CSS

My personal goal is tu use as much CSS as I can instead of adding JS. For example instead of a accordion with the help of JS I use details. To get the given requirements I have animated and made the accordion only have one row open at a time. So opening a new closes the other. In chrome inspector i have activated "Show user agent shadow DOM" to be able to see the Shadow ROOT so I can target specific classes in details.

## JS

The only JS I have is for the light-dark mode switch.


## Design decisions

I took a decision to not create the store buttons for App Store and Google Play as shown in the Figma file. After some research i found out that Apple and Google has badges that developers uses. They have restricted how they are used. For example Google Play has recently change their colors in the logo. The sizing is pre decided and the "rules" state that if there is another app store the buttons need to have the same height. When it comes to third party mentions that is not allowed. I did not have time to redo all the images, but some in some of them i have blurred out the company name and logo.
