# HTML/CSS assignment

This is the first assignment at [EC Utbildning](https://ecutbildning.se/) where I am studying WebDev .Net.
I was given a Figma file that I am using to design the page.

## HTML/CSS

My personal goal is tu use as much CSS as I can instead of adding JS. For example instead of a accordion with the help of JS I use details. To get the given requirements I have animated and made the accordion only have one row open at a time. So opening a new closes the other. In chrome inspector i have activated "Show user agent shadow DOM" to be able to see the Shadow ROOT so I can target specific classes in details.

## JS

The only JS I have is for the light-dark mode switch.
